    "\n",
    "Why is WSGI used?\n",
    "\n",
    "It acts as a bridge between web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) and Python web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows Python web frameworks like Flask or Django to handle requests and send responses in a standardized way.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you deploy a Flask application on a web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI. The web server receives a request (e.g., accessing www.example.com) and forwards it to your Flask app via WSGI. Your Flask app processes the request (e.g., fetching data from a database) and sends the response back to the web server, which delivers it to the user's browser.\n",

    "\n",

    "Flask integrates Jinja2 to render templates (HTML files).\n",

    "Why is Jinja2 used?\n",
    "\n",
    "To separate the logic (Python code) from the presentation (HTML content).\n",

    "Imagine you’re building an e-commerce site. Using Jinja2, you can render an HTML page with a list of products dynamically pulled from a database. Instead of hardcoding each product, Jinja2 can loop through the data and display the product name, price, and image.\n",

    "\n",
    "Accessing JSON Data:\n",
    "It extracts the JSON payload(A JSON payload refers to the actual data sent in the body of an HTTP request or response in the JSON format.Typically used in POST, PUT, or PATCH requests to send data to the server.) sent in the request body and converts it into a Python dictionary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simplifies Parsing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually parsing the request data, Flask's request.json provides a convenient and direct way to get the JSON as a Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the client sends malformed JSON or no JSON at all, request.json returns None instead of throwing an error. You can handle this gracefully in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client sends a request with JSON data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP headers of the request must include Content-Type: application/json.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON data is sent in the body of the HTTP request.\n",

    "Flask automatically reads the body of the request, decodes the JSON, and makes it available as request.json"
